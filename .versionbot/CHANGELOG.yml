    - subject: "balena-image-flasher-unwrap: extend file match to include extension"
      hash: a4de0cf17ed8dff073fb317a7f896565f7a47126
      body: |
        New images include both a raw image and its signature, which makes
        the script fail when the match returns the signature file.

        This commit introduces an exact match on the `balenaos-img` extension to
        prevent this.

        Previously the extracted image had the same name

        the name.

      subject: "resin-image-flasher-unwrap: Do not check image format if not present"
      body: >-
        The standard flow for this tool is to unwrap a resin-image from a

        resin-image-flasher.

        On commit cea5fc2a5623 the option of converting it to a different format
        to

        use in emulators was introduced, but the image format was made
        compulsory

        with the script exiting if not provided.

        This commit only checks the validity of image format when actually
        provided.

        The tool is not intuitive enough to be used as it stands, so improve the
        documentation to make it more user friendly.

        ==================
        --format [vdi/vhd/vmdk]
        For creating images suitable for various VM platforms.
        --image-size xxG
        Set the block device image size, which will be expanded
        into when booting the image.
        Auto-build Docker image
        =======================
        There is now no need to build the tool first, it will be built whenever
        the `docker-run` script is executed. This doesn't impact
        performance on subsequent runs.
